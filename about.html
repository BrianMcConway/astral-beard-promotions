                A beard is the hair that grows on the jaw, chin, upper lip, lower lip, cheeks, and neck of humans and
                some non-human animals. In humans, usually pubescent or adult males are able to start growing beards, on
                average at the age of 18.[1]

                Throughout the course of history, societal attitudes toward male beards have varied widely depending on
                factors such as prevailing cultural-religious traditions and the current era's fashion trends. Some
                religions (such as some sects of Islam, and Sikhism) have considered a full beard to be essential and
                mandate it as part of their observance.[2] Other cultures, even while not officially mandating it, view
                a beard as central to a man's virility, exemplifying such virtues as wisdom, strength, sexual prowess
                and high social status. In cultures where facial hair is uncommon (or currently out of fashion), beards
                may be associated with poor hygiene or an unconventional demeanor. In countries with colder climates,
                beards help protect the wearer's face from the elements. Beards also provide sun protection.[3]
